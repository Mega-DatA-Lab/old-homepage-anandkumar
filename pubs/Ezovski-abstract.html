<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Peer-to-peer (P2P) file distribution is a scalable way to disseminate
content to a wide audience. This paper presents an algorithm by which
download times are sequentially minimized; that is, the first peer's
download time is minimized, and subsequent peers' times are minimized
conditional on their predecessors' times being minimized. This objective
gives robustness to the file distribution in the case that the network may
be partitioned. It is also an important step towards the natural objective
of minimizing the average download time, which is made challenging by the
combinatorial structure of the problem. This optimality result not only
provides fundamental insight to scheduling in such P2P systems, but also
can serve as a benchmark to evaluate practical algorithms and illustrate
the scalability of P2P networks.
