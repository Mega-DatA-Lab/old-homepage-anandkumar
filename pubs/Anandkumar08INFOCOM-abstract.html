<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of minimum cost in-network fusion of measurements, collected
from distributed sensors via multihop routing is considered. A designated
fusion center performs an optimal statistical-inference test on the
correlated measurements, drawn from a Markov random field. Conditioned on
the delivery of a sufficient statistic for inference to the fusion center,
the structure of optimal routing and fusion is shown to be a Steiner tree
on a transformed graph. This Steiner-tree reduction preserves the
approximation ratio, which implies that any Steiner-tree approximation can
be employed for minimum cost fusion with the same approximation ratio. The
proposed fusion scheme involves routing packets of two types, v.i.z., raw
measurements sent for local processing, and aggregates obtained on
combining these processed values. The performance of heuristics for
minimum cost fusion are evaluated through theory and simulations, showing
a significant saving in routing costs, when compared to routing all the
raw measurements to the fusion center.
