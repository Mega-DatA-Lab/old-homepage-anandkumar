<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of maximizing detection performance subject to an energy
constraint is analyzed in an asymptotic setting. The correlation between
the sensor measurements is incorporated through the Gauss-Markov random
field with Euclidean nearest-neighbor dependency graph. An average energy
constraint is imposed on a routing scheme with an approximation factor of
two, and the resulting Neyman-Pearson error exponent is optimized with
respect to the density of the deployed sensors. It is shown that the
behavior of this optimal density crucially depends on the ratio between
the measurement variances under the two hypotheses and displays a
threshold behavior. Below the threshold value of the variance ratio, the
optimal density tends towards infinity for any feasible energy constraint.
On the other hand, when the variance ratio is above the threshold, the
optimal density is characterized by the energy constraint.
