<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of hypothesis testing against independence for a Gauss-Markov
random field (GMRF) with nearest-neighbor dependency graph is analyzed.
The sensors measuring samples from the signal field are placed IID
according to the uniform distribution. The asymptotic performance of
Neyman-Pearson detection is characterized through the large-deviation
theory. An expression for the error exponent is derived using a special
law of large numbers for graph functionals. The exponent is analyzed for
different values of the variance ratio and correlation. It is found that a
more correlated GMRF has a higher exponent (improved detection
performance) at low values of the variance ratio, whereas the opposite is
true at high values of the ratio.
