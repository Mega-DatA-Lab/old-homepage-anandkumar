<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In this correspondence, the problem of distributed Bayesian estimation is
considered in the context of a wireless sensor network. The Bayesian
estimation performance is analyzed in terms of the expected Fisher
information normalized by the transmission rate of the sensors. The
sensors use a communication scheme known as the type-based random access
(TBRA) scheme. Under a constraint on the expected transmission energy, an
optimal spatio–temporal allocation scheme that maximizes the performance
metric is characterized. It is shown that the performance metric is
crucially dependent on the fading parameter known as the channel coherence
index. For channels with low coherence indices, sensor transmissions tend
to cancel each other, and there exists an optimal finite mean transmission
rate that maximizes the performance metric. On the other hand, for
channels with high coherence indices, there should be as many simultaneous
transmissions as allowed by the network. The presence of a critical
coherence index where the change from one behavior to another occurs is
established.
