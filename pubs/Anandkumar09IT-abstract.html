<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of hypothesis testing against independence for a Gauss-Markov
random field (GMRF) is analyzed. Assuming an acyclic dependency graph, an
expression for the log-likelihood ratio of detection is derived. Assuming
random placement of nodes over a large region according to the Poisson or
uniform distribution and nearest-neighbor dependency graph, the error
exponent of the Neyman-Pearson detector is derived using large-deviations
theory. The error exponent is expressed as a dependency-graph functional
and the limit is evaluated through a special law of large numbers for
<var>stabilizing</var> graph functionals. The exponent is analyzed for
different values of the variance ratio and correlation. It is found that a
more correlated GMRF has a higher exponent at low values of the variance
ratio whereas the situation is reversed at high values of the variance
ratio.
