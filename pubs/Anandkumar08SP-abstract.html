<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of optimal node density maximizing the Neyman-Pearson
detection error exponent subject to a constraint on average (per node)
energy consumption is analyzed. The spatial correlation among the sensor
measurements is incorporated through a Gauss-Markov random field model
with Euclidean nearest-neighbor dependency graph. A random constant
density deployment of sensors under uniform or Poisson distribution is
assumed. It is shown that the optimal node density crucially depends on
the ratio between the measurement variances under the two hypotheses and
displays a threshold behavior. Below the threshold value of the variance
ratio, the optimal node density tends to infinity under any feasible
average energy constraint. On the other hand, when the variance ratio is
above the threshold, the optimal node density is the minimum value at
which it is feasible to process and deliver the likelihood ratio
(sufficient statistic) of the sensor measurements to the fusion center. In
this regime of the variance ratio, an upper bound on this optimal node
density based on a proposed 2-approximation fusion scheme and a lower
bound based on the minimum spanning tree are established. Under an
alternative formulation where the energy consumption per unit area is
constrained, the optimal node density is shown to be strictly finite for
all values of the variance ratio and bounds on this optimal node density
are provided.
