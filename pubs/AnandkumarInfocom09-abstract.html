<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
A novel formulation for optimal sensor selection and in-network fusion for
distributed inference known as the prize-collecting data fusion (PCDF) is
proposed in terms of optimal tradeoff between the costs of aggregating the
selected set of sensor measurements and the resulting inference
performance at the fusion center. For i.i.d. measurements, PCDF reduces to
the prize-collecting Steiner tree (PCST) with the single-letter
Kullback-Leibler divergence as the penalty at each node, as the number of
nodes goes to infinity. PCDF is then analyzed under a correlation model
specified by a Markov random field (MRF) with a given dependency graph.
For a special class of dependency graphs, a constrained version of the
PCDF reduces to the PCST on an augmented graph. In this case, an
approximation algorithm is given with the approximation ratio depending
only on the number of profitable cliques in the dependency graph. Based on
these results, two heuristics are proposed for node selection under
general correlation structure, and their performance is studied via
simulations.
