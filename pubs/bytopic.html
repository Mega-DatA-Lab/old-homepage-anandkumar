<h1><a name="Learning_of_Graphical_Models" id="Learning_of_Graphical_Models">Learning of Graphical Models</a></h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> A graphical model, also known as a
  Markov random field is a succinct representation of a multivariate distribution, where the conditional independence relationships are represented as a graph. Mathematically, two nodes are non-neighbors in the dependency graph iff. their data are statistical independent, conditioned on the data at all the other nodes.</p>
<p>A major challenge is that the graph structure of the graphical model is typically unknown and has to be learnt from samples. The goal is to obtain consistent algorithms which output the correct structure as the number of samples goes to infinity. Typically, the data is high dimensional, meaning that the data dimensionality is comparable to the number of samples. Hence, it is desirable to have algorithms with low sample complexity. Computational complexity is another performance criterion. Learning a general graphical model is NP-hard and it is of interest to find classes of graphs where learning is tractable.

<h1><a name="Inference_in_Graphical_Models">Inference in Graphical Models</a></h1>
<p> <strong>Overview:</strong> In this line of work, graphical models are employed to model relationships between data collected at different nodes in the networks such as the sensor networks. The end goal is to undertake distributed statiscal inference about the environment using the samples. In-network computation schemes which incorporate the graphical model information are considered and the scalability of these schemes as the size of the network grows is studied.

<h1><a name="Multi-armed_Bandits" id="Multi-armed_Bandits">Adaptive Learning and Distributed Access</a></h1><p><strong>Overview:</strong> The problem of adaptive learning of channel availability and medium access control among multiple secondary users in a cognitive radio network is considered. Due to lack of coordination and information exchange among the users and due to unknown channel availabilities, the cognitive users experience regret and efficient decentralized algorithms are designed with order-optimal sum regret. This involves multi-armed bandits with multiple users.</p>

<p> <strong>Overview:</strong> The design of scalable medium access control and channel computation algorithms  for statistical inference applications is considered. Here, scalability is in terms of having low bandwidth requirements with network size.  Traditionally, MAC schemes allocate
transmission from different  nodes to   orthogonal channels (such as
in time or frequency) to avoid interference. Instead, we propose a
MAC scheme where nodes may interfere with one another, yet achieve
good inference accuracy in the end. We allocate orthogonal channels
to data levels: all nodes reaching the same local decision use the
same orthogonal channel to transmit, if they decide to do so. </p><dl>

<h1><a name="Transaction_Monitoring" id="Transaction_Monitoring">Network Monitoring Using Timestamps</a></h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> I spent two summers at IBM Watson Research   and worked on network monitoring problems relevant to managing financial cyber-infrastructure. Automated fine-grained monitoring solutions are needed to manage these large, complex and heterogeneous networks. We established a mathematical framework for probabilistic  tracking of packets using only timestamps with no access to packet payload or packet identifier. We proposed scalable monitoring algorithms with decentralized implementation which are  provably optimal for monitoring.</p><dl>
