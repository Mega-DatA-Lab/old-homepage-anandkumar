<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of routing of sensor observations for optimal detection of a
Markov random field (MRF) at a designated fusion center is analyzed.
Assuming that the correlation structure of the MRF is defined by the
nearest-neighbor dependency graph, routing schemes which minimize the
total energy consumption are analyzed. It is shown that the optimal
routing scheme involves data fusion at intermediate nodes and requires
transmissions of two types, v.i.z., the raw sensor data and the aggregates
of log-likelihood ratio (LLR). The raw data is transmitted among the
neighbors in the dependency graph and local contributions to the LLR are
computed. These local contributions are then aggregated and delivered to
the fusion center. A 2-approximation routing algorithm (DFMRF) is proposed
and it has a transmission multidigraph consisting of the dependency graph
and the directed minimum spanning tree, with the directions toward the
fusion center.}, %supersededby={Anandkumar08INFOCOM
