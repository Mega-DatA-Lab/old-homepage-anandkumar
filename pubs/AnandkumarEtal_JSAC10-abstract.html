<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The problem of distributed learning and channel access  is considered   in a cognitive network  with multiple secondary users. The availability statistics of the channels are initially unknown to the secondary users and are estimated using sensing 
  decisions. There is no explicit information exchange or prior 
  agreement  among the secondary users. We propose policies  for distributed learning and access which achieve order-optimal  cognitive system throughput (number of successful secondary transmissions) under self play, i.e., when implemented at all the secondary users. Equivalently, our policies minimize the regret in distributed learning and access. We first consider the scenario when the number of secondary users is known to the policy, and prove  that the total regret is logarithmic in the number of transmission slots.   Our distributed learning and access policy achieves order-optimal   regret  by comparing  to an asymptotic  lower bound for   regret  under any uniformly-good learning and access policy. We then consider the case when    the number of secondary users is fixed but unknown, and is estimated through feedback.  We propose a policy in this scenario whose  asymptotic sum regret which grows  slightly faster than logarithmic in the number of transmission slots.</p>
