<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of distributed fusion for binary hypothesis testing in a
multihop network is considered. The sensor measurements are spatially
correlated according to a Markov random field (MRF) under both the
hypotheses. A fusion scheme for detection involves selection and localized
processing of a subset of sensor measurements, fusion of these processed
values to form a sufficient statistic, and its delivery to the fusion
center. The goal is to find a fusion scheme that achieves optimal linear
tradeoff between the total routing costs and the resulting detection error
exponent at the fusion center. The Neyman-Pearson error exponent, under a
fixed type-I bound, is shown to be the limit of the normalized sum of the
Kullback-Leibler distances (KLD) over the maximal cliques of the MRF under
some convergence conditions. It is shown that optimal fusion reduces to a
<var>prize-collecting Steiner tree</var> (PCST) with the approximation
factor preserved when the cliques of the MRF are disjoint. The PCST is
found over an expanded communication graph with virtual nodes added for
each non-trivial maximal clique of the MRF and their KLD assigned as the
node penalty.
