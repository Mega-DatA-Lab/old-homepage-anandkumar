<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of cooperative allocation among multiple secondary users to
avoid collisions in a cognitive radio network is considered. The channel
availability statistics are initially unknown to all the secondary users
and are learnt via sensing samples. Distributed learning and allocation
schemes which minimize the total regret of the users when compared with
the ideal scenario with known availability statistics and centralized
allocation are proposed. The first scheme assumes minimal prior
information in terms of pre-allocated ranks for allocation while the
second scheme is fully distributed and assumes no prior information at the
users. The two schemes have sum regret which is provably logarithmic in
the total number of access slots. A lower bound is derived for any
learning scheme which is asymptotically logarithmic in the number of
slots. Hence, our schemes achieve asymptotic order optimality in terms of
regret in learning and allocation.
