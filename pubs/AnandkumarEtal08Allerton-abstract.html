<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The energy scaling laws of multihop data fusion networks for distributed
inference are considered. The fusion network consists of randomly located
sensors independently distributed according to a general spatial
distribution in an expanding region. Among the class of data fusion
schemes that enable optimal inference at the fusion center for Markov
random field hypotheses, the minimum per-sensor energy cost is bounded
below by a minimum spanning tree data fusion and above by a suboptimal
scheme referred to as Data Fusion for Markov Random Field (DFMRF). Scaling
laws are derived for the optimal and suboptimal fusion policies.
