<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of tracking end-to-end service-level transactions in the
absence of instrumentation support is considered. The transaction
instances progress through a state-transition model and generate
time-stamped footprints on entering each state in the model. The goal is
to track individual transactions using these footprints even when the
footprints may not contain any tokens uniquely identifying the transaction
instances that generated them. Assuming a semi-Markov process model for
state transitions, the transaction instances are tracked probabilistically
by matching them to the available footprints according to the maximum
likelihood (ML) criterion. Under the ML-rule, for a two-state system, it
is shown that the probability that all the instances are matched correctly
is minimized when the transition times are i.i.d. exponentially
distributed. When the transition times are i.i.d. distributed, the ML-rule
reduces to a minimum weight bipartite matching and reduces further to a
first-in first-out match for a special class of distributions. For a
multi-state model with an acyclic state transition digraph, a constructive
proof shows that the ML-rule reduces to splicing the results of
independent matching of many bipartite systems.
