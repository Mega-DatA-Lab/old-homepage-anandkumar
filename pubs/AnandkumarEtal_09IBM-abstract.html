<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Current distributed systems incorporate legacy subsystems which may not be
specifically instrumented for monitoring the end-to-end business
transactions supported by these systems. While a level of monitoring is
possible by observing the log-records produced by these systems,
retrofitting them with monitoring instrumentation provides precise
high-granularity monitoring of transactions, but is an expensive
proposition. Given a limited budget for such retrofitting, optimal
instrumentation strategy which maximizes the effectiveness of monitoring
transactions throughout the system is proposed. The operation of the
end-to-end system is modeled by a queuing network; each queue represents a
subsystem which produces time-stamped log-records as transactions pass
through it. If a transition link in the state diagram of the queueing
network is selected for retrofitting instrumentation (i.e., the subsystems
connected through that link), then we can precisely monitor the
transactions passing through that link. A simple heuristic which selects
transition links for instrumentation in the decreasing order of their load
factors is proposed. Sufficient conditions on the service distributions at
the queues are proven for the load-factor heuristic to be optimal using
the notion of stochastic order. An alternative heuristic, efficient in the
low arrival-rate regime, is also proposed. Simulations show the
effectiveness of our solutions under a variety of load conditions,
outperforming ad hoc instrumentation strategies.
