<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The problem of binary hypothesis testing is considered when the
measurements are drawn from a Markov random field (MRF) under each
hypothesis. Spatial dependence of the measurements is incorporated by
parameterizing the clique potential functions of each MRF with the
location of the nodes from which the samples are collected. The nodes are
placed i.i.d. in expanding areas with increasing sample size. Asymptotic
performance of hypothesis testing is analyzed through the Neyman-Pearson
error exponent. It is shown that the exponent reduces to a functional on a
stabilizing graph. Using the law of large numbers for graph functionals,
the error exponent is derived as a function of the node placement
distribution.
