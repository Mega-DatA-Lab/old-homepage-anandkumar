            <p class = "description">Robust tensor CP decomposition involves decomposing a tensor into low rank and sparse components.
We propose a novel non-convex iterative algorithm with guaranteed recovery. It alternates between lowrank
CP decomposition through gradient ascent (a variant of the tensor power method), and hard
thresholding of the residual. We prove convergence to the globally optimal solution under natural incoherence
conditions on the low rank component, and bounded level of sparse perturbations. We compare
our method with natural baselines, viz., which apply robust matrix PCA either to the flattened tensor,
or to the matrix slices of the tensor. Our method can provably handle a far greater level of perturbation
when the sparse tensor is block-structured.

            <p class = "description">Learning latent variable mixture models in high-dimension is applicable in numerous domains where low dimensional latent
factors out of the high-dimensional observations are desired. Popular likelihood based methods optimize over a non-convex
likelihood which is computationally challenging to achieve due to the high-dimensionality of the data, and therefore it is usually
not guaranteed to converge to a global or even local optima without additional assumptions. We propose a framework to
overcome the problem of unscalable and non-convex likelihood by taking the power of inverse method of moments. By
matching the moments, the problem of learning latent variable mixture models is reduced to a tensor (higher order matrix)
decomposition problem in low-dimensional space. This framework incorporates dimensionality reduction and thus is scalable
to high-dimensional data. Moreover, we show that the algorithm is highly parallel and implemented a distributed version on
Spark in Scala language.
