            <p class = "description">The course will incorporate latest advances in large-scale machine learning. We are seeing a data deluge in every domain and developing principled machine learning approaches to process high dimensional data is highly pertinent. This course will lay the foundation for analysis of large-scale learning and provide a lens to some of the most exciting recent theoretical developments. At the same time, the students will get to deploy the algorithms on a cloud platform and understand the practical implications and tradeoffs involved. </p>

            <p class = "description">This course draws from statistics and machine learning and is an in depth study of learning algorithms. This is an advanced graduate level course. We will cover supervised learning, kernel methods, non-parametrics, optimization for machine learning, and concentration bounds.</p>

            <p class = "description">This course is an intermediate, graduate level probability and random processes course for engineers. We will begin with an overview / review of probability basics, and then develop the more formal measure-theoretic foundations, as well as other concepts useful in subsequent courses. In addition we will discuss the most common  probabilistic models and random processes, with a view on important applications in  communications, control and signal processing, as well as other fields in engineering and computer sciences.</p>
