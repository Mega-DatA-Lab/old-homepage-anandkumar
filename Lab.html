analyses for model estimation via graphical approaches, and applying
them for analyzing high-dimensional data. In the theoretical domain,
currently, we are investigating graph estimation in probabilistic graphical
models and parameter estimation in latent variable models. We are
applying these methods to exciting problems in social network analysis,
computational biology and text analysis.</p>

                  <h3>Convolutional Dictionary Learning through Tensor Factorization</h3>
                  <p class="ProjectIntro">
                     Tensor methods have emerged as a powerful paradigm for consistent learning of many latent variable models such as topic models, independent component analysis and dictionary learning. Model parameters are estimated via CP decomposition of the observed higher order input moments. However, in many domains, additional invariances such as shift invariances exist, enforced via models such as convolutional dictionary learning. In this paper, we develop novel tensor decomposition algorithms for parameter estimation of convolutional models. Our algorithm is based on the popular alternating least squares method, but with efficient projections onto the space of stacked circulant matrices. Our method is embarrassingly parallel and consists of simple operations such as fast Fourier transforms and matrix multiplications. Our algorithm converges to the dictionary much faster and more accurately compared to the alternating minimization over filters and activation maps. &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/Lab/Lab_sub/ConvDictionaryLearning.html" style="text-decoration:none">Read more</a>

                  <p class="ProjectIntro">
                     We present an integrated approach to structure and parameter estimation in latent tree graphical models, where some nodes are hidden. Our overall approach follows a divide-and-conquer strategy that learns models over small groups of variables and iteratively merges into a global solution. The structure learning involves combinatorial operations such as minimum spanning tree construction and local recursive grouping; the parameter learning is based on the method of moments and on tensor decompositions. Our method is guaranteed to correctly recover the unknown tree structure and the model parameters with low sample complexity for the class of linear multivariate latent tree models which includes discrete and Gaussian distributions, and Gaussian mixtures. Our bulk asynchronous parallel algorithm is implemented in parallel using the OpenMP framework and scales logarithmically with the number of variables and linearly with dimensionality of each variable. Our experiments confirm a high degree of efficiency and accuracy on large datasets of electronic health records. The proposed algorithm also generates intuitive and clinically meaningful disease hierarchies. &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/Lab/Lab_sub/LatentTreeParallel.html" style="text-decoration:none">Read more</a>

                  <p class="ProjectIntro">
                     We present a fast tensor-based approach for detecting hidden overlapping communities under the Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel (MMSB). We present two implementations, viz., a GPU-based implementation which exploits the parallelism of SIMD architectures and a CPU-based implementation for larger datasets, wherein the GPU memory does not suffice. Our GPU-based implementation involves a careful optimization of storage, data transfer and matrix computations. Our CPU-based implementation involves sparse linear algebraic operations which exploit the data sparsity. We use stochastic gradient descent for multilinear spectral optimization and this allows for flexibility in the tradeoff between node sub-sampling and accuracy of the results. We validate our results on datasets from Facebook, Yelp and DBLP where ground truth is available, using notions of p-values and false discovery rates, and obtain high accuracy for membership recovery. We compare our results, both in terms of execution time and accuracy, to the state-of-the-art algorithms such as the variational method, and report many orders of magnitude gain in the execution time. For instance, for the DBLP dataset with about a million nodes and 16 million edges, the execution time is about two minutes. &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/Lab/Lab_sub/community.html" style="text-decoration:none">Read more</a>

                     With current trends in large-scale machine learning, we require methods that are fast, cheap to implement and have high accuracy. The algorithm should be robust to noise as in reality we only have access to noisy samples and we need to make fast decisions based on such samples. One of the main applications of this framework is streaming.

We propose an efficient algorithm based on ADMM with guarantees for high-dimensional problems.

                  <p class="ProjectIntro">
                      Learning several latent variable models including multi-view mixtures, mixture of Gaussians, independent component analysis and so on can be done by the decomposition of a low-order moment tensor (e.g., 3rd order tensor) to its rank-1 components. Many earlier studies using tensor methods only consider undercomplete regime where the number of hidden components is smaller than the observed dimension. In these series of works, we show that the tensor power iteration (as the key element for tensor decomposition) works well even in the overcomplete regime where the hidden dimension is larger than the observed dimension. We establish that a wide range of overcomplete latent variable models can be learned efficiently with low computational and sample complexity through tensor power iteration.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/Lab/Lab_sub/OvercompleteDecomposition.html" style="text-decoration:none">Read more</a>

In this project, we present a novel framework incorporating sparsity in different domains.MarkovIndepModel

                   Tensor Power Method as a robust tensor CP decomposition involves decomposing a tensor into summation of its rank-one components. We provide simple Matlab code for tensor power method. In this code we show how this code whitens the input tensor by taking the SVD of its diagonal slice and apples iterative algorithm on whitened tensor to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We illustrate how it computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of whitened tensor by iterative algorithm. At each iteration it multiplies the input tensor by a vector and normalize the result vector. Then multiply the tensor again by the result vector and normalize it again. It does it on and on until the iterative algorithm converges to a stable vector. We store this final vector and its normalization coefficient. For next step, it deflates the corresponding rank one tensor from the original whitened tensor and update the original whitened tensor. After that it pursues the iteration and deflation until the original whitened tensor vanishes. Then we show how it dewhitens the stored vectors and their corresponding coefficients to come up with eigenvalues and eigenvectors original tensor.

                  <p class="SoftwareIntro">
                    Learning latent variable mixture models in high-dimension is applicable in numerous domains where low dimensional latent
factors out of the high-dimensional observations are desired. Popular likelihood based methods optimize over a non-convex
likelihood which is computationally challenging to achieve due to the high-dimensionality of the data, and therefore it is usually
not guaranteed to converge to a global or even local optima without additional assumptions. We propose a framework to
overcome the problem of unscalable and non-convex likelihood by taking the power of inverse method of moments. By
matching the moments, the problem of learning latent variable mixture models is reduced to a tensor (higher order matrix)
decomposition problem in low-dimensional space. This framework incorporates dimensionality reduction and thus is scalable
to high-dimensional data. Moreover, we show that the algorithm is highly parallel and implemented a distributed version on
